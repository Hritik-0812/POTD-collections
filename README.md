## 📂 Repository Structure

Each file follows a consistent naming convention:

```
ProblemNumber. Problem Title.cpp
```

### 🔎 Example

```
1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits.cpp
1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K.cpp
```


### 📁 Organization Approach

- Problems are stored individually as separate `.cpp` files  
- File names match the exact problem number and title  
- Solutions are written in clean and optimized C++  
- Focus is on readability and efficiency  

This structure ensures:

- ✅ Easy navigation through solved problems  
- ✅ Quick revision before interviews  
- ✅ Clear tracking of problem-solving progress  
- ✅ Organized and scalable repository growth  

As the repository grows, it will continue to follow this standardized structure for consistency.
